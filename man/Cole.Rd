\usage{
Cole(
  X,
  Y = NULL,
  alpha = 0.95,
  Fisher = TRUE,
  covar = "iid",
  m_rep = 10000,
  c_seq = NA,
  n = 10000,
  details_inference = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a numeric vector, matrix or data frame with values of 0 or 1. Alternatively, a 2 x 2 matrix / contingency table can be supplied. In that case, the upper left corner shall contain the joint success probability (or frequency). If a 3-dimensional vector of probabilities is supplied, the order (p, q, r) shall be respected. p denotes the success probability of the row variable, q the success probability of the column variable and r the joint success probability.}

\item{Y}{NULL (default) or a n x 1 numeric vector, matrix or data frame with values of 0 or 1 and compatible dimensions to X.}

\item{alpha}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval. FALSE yields Cole's C without confidence intervals.}

\item{Fisher}{indicator whether confidence intervals should be computed by using the Fisher Transformation. Default is TRUE.}

\item{covar}{method that is used to compute the covariance matrix, denoted Omega in \insertCite{pohle2024measuringdependenceevents}{BCor}, see in particular Appendix C. Options are eiher  iid ("iid"), heteroskedasticity ("HC") or heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation ("HACâ€œ), where the latter two follow the method of \insertCite{NeweyWest1987}{BCor}.}

\item{m_rep}{number of Monte Carlo replications used for approximating the limiting distribution of Cole's C \insertCite{pohle2024measuringdependenceevents}{BCor}.}

\item{c_seq}{sequence of C_0 (null hypothesis) to be tested for computing the confidence interval. Default is the sequence from -0.999 to 0.999 with distance 0.001 \insertCite{pohle2024measuringdependenceevents}{BCor}.}

\item{n}{sample size. Only necessary if probabilities are provided and confidence intervals are desired.}

\item{details_inference}{logical. If TRUE, the output includes all 3 p-values that arise during the testing procedure that yields confidence intervals \insertCite{pohle2024measuringdependenceevents}{BCor}.}
}
\value{
The value of Cole's correlation together with the specified confidence interval.
}
\description{
\code{Cole()} computes Cole's correlation and corresponding confidence intervals.

\examples{
# Insert a contingency table with frequencies in form of a matrix.
x <- matrix(c(10, 20, 30, 5), ncol = 2)
Cole(x)

# Insert a contingency table with relative frequencies in form of a matrix.
# In that case, disable confidence intervals via alpha = FALSE or supply a sample size n.
x <- matrix(c(0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3), ncol = 2)
Cole(x, alpha = FALSE)

# Insert two vectors of observations.
x <- c(0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1)
y <- c(1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0)
Cole(x, y)

# Insert two marginal success probabilities (p for the row variable and q for the column variable)
# and a joint success probability r. In that case, disable confidence intervals via alpha = FALSE
# or supply a sample size n.
p <- 0.6
q <- 0.3
r <- 0.2
Cole(c(p, q, r), alpha = FALSE)
