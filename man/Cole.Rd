\title{Cole's Correlation}
\usage{
Cole(
  X,
  Y = NULL,
  alpha = 0.95,
  Fisher = TRUE,
  covar = "iid",
  m_rep = 10000,
  c_seq = NA,
  n,
  details_inference = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a n x 1 numeric vector, matrix or data frame with values of 0 or 1.}

\item{Y}{a n x 1 numeric vector, matrix or data frame with values of 0 or 1.}

\item{alpha}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval. FALSE yields Cole's C without confidence intervals.}

\item{Fisher}{Indicator whether confidence intervals should be computed by using the Fisher Transformation. Default is TRUE.}

\item{covar}{data assumptions: iid ("iid"), heteroskedasticity ("HC") or heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation ("HAC").}

\item{m_rep}{number of Monte Carlo replications used for approximating the limiting distribution of Cole's C.}

\item{c_seq}{sequence of C_0 to be tested for computing the confidence interval. Default is the sequence from -0.999 to 0.999 with distance 0.001.}

\item{n}{sample size. Only necessary if a contingency table of probabilities is provided and confidence intervals are desired.}

\item{details_inference}{logical. If TRUE, the output includes all 3 p-values that arise during the testing procedure that yields confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
The value of Cole's correlation.
}
\description{
\code{Cole()} computes Cole's correlation and corresponding confidence intervals.

\examples{
x <- matrix(c(10, 20, 30, 5), ncol = 2)
Cole(x)
